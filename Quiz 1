# Question 1 

a = float(input("Please enter a value for a: "))
b = float(input("Please enter a value for b: "))
c = float(input("Please enter a value for c: "))
x = float(input("Please enter a value for x: "))

result = a*x**2 + b*x + c
print("The value of the polynomial is")
print(a, "x^2 + ", b, "x + ", c)
print("at x =", x, "is", result)

# Question 2

grade_list = [[87, 69], [77, 91], [92, 88], [74, 63]]

student = int(input("Which student would you like to see the score for?: "))
exam = int(input("Which exam score would you like to see for that student: "))
if student > 4 or student <= 0:
    print("This is invalid")

if exam <= 0 or exam > 2:
    print("This is invalid")

print("Student",student,"got a score of",grade_list[student-1][exam-1],"on exam",exam)

# Question 3 

first_name = input("Please enter your first name: ")
last_name = input("Please en1ter your last name: ")
birth_date = input("Please enter your birth date as MM/DD/YYYY where month and day are two digits: ")
username = [first_name, last_name, "uic", birth_date]
print(username[0][0]+ username[1][0]+username[2]+\
      username[3][1]+username[3][4]+username[3][-2]+username[3][-1])

# Question 4

# x = input('Please enter a number that isn't negative: ')

# int should be used before input
# an if statement should be used to cause an error if negative number is applied

# f(x) = x^0.5

# x**0.5 should be used instead
# replace f(x) with y because f(x) causes an error

# print(The square root of x is, f(x))

# print statement should be in quotations up into "is" then a comma should be used for the variable
